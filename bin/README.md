Spring Social Quickstart 3.0.x
==============================
This sample is a Spring 3.0.5-compatible implementation of the Quick Start sample. It's designed to get you up and running quickly with Spring Social in a Spring Framework 3.0.x environment.

**NOTE**: Starting with Spring Social 1.1.0, Spring Social no longer supports compatibility with Spring Framework 3.0.x. This example remains for those still using Spring Social 1.0.x.

To run, simply import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 2.5 or > container such as Tomcat 6 or 7.
You can also deploy from the command line with:
$ mvn tomcat:run

Access the project at http://localhost:8080/spring-social-quickstart-30x
